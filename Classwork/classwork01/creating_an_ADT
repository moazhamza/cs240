What data will your Data Structure be made up of?

    Ant ID (Name or number)
    Ant Location (x,y)

What operations will the data sturcture need?

    Update ant locations
    Add new ants
    Delete an ant (death)

What are the resource constraints (time and memory) for create, read, update, and delete?

    Create - memory restraints on the number of ants
    Read - time to find corressponding ant location
    Update - time to find the correct ant to update
    Delete - time to find the correct ant to delete
